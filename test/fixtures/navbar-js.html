    <h1>A Flight to Remember</h1>
    <p>Shut up and take my money! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Bender, quit destroying the universe! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</p>
    <h2>The Late Philip J. Fry</h2>
    <p>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. But existing is basically all I do! Okay, I like a challenge.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li>
      <li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li>
      <li>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</li>
      <li>Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</li>

    <p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p>
    <h4>I Second That Emotion</h4>
    <p>I don't want to be rescued. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.  And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</li>

    <p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? It's toe-tappingly tragic!</p>
